# JavaBackend

This repository contains my Java studies with a focus on backend development. It includes exercises from my Software Engineering course at IFSP and additional activities I created on my own to deepen my knowledge.

## 📚 Contents

The repository is organized by folders, typically following the pattern `lessonXX`, which represent study topics or weeks. Inside each folder, there are packages with specific exercises.

### Examples of what you will find here:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File handling
- Data structures (lists, stacks, queues)
- Best practices with modern Java (using `Optional`, validations, custom exceptions)
- Layered architecture projects (model, service, main, etc.)
- Exercises focusing on logic and system modeling

## 🚀 Objective

This repository serves as a continuous learning space. It acts as both a reference for reviewing concepts and a demonstration of my progress with Java and backend development in general.

## 📁 Organization

Projects and exercises are grouped in packages within folders named by class or topic. Each exercise has its own structure, and the package names help identify its purpose.
